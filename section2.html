<!--Was either hypothesis supported for beetles?

None of the relationships were significant except for the graph that plots &Delta;UTL vs. mean UTL. Interestingly, &Delta;UTL increased as mean UTL increased, which is the opposite of what the trade-off hypothesis predicted.
<br>
However, we didn't see enough evidence to support the latitudinal hypothesis either, possibly due to the small sample size.

<h4>Data from Gunderson & Stillman (2015)</h4>
<!--Now, let's take a look at a larger dataset with more taxa. The data were collected by <a href = "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2015.0401">Gunderson & Stillman in 2015 </a> and cover amphibians, crustaceans, fish, insects, and reptiles. 
<br>
In this dataset, the data collected include habitat type and seasonality in addition to latitude, UTL, LTL, &Delta;UTL, and &Delta;LTL. The seasonality is the measurement of the standard deviation of annual mean weekly air (or Sea surface for marine habitats) temperatures extracted from Bioclim climatic layers. In this study, &Delta;UTL and &Delta;LTL are measured as acclimation response ratio, which is the slope of the line describing the change in thermal tolerance with a given change in acclimation temperature.
<br>
For this activity, you can switch around the axes and try with different taxa and habitat types to see if any hypothesis is supported.
