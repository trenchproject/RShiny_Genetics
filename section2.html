<h3>Data from Gunderson & Stillman (2015)</h3>

Now, let's take a look at a larger dataset with more taxa. The data were collected from literature by Gunderson & Stillman in 2015 and cover amphibians, crustaceans, fish, insects, and reptiles.

In this dataset, the data collected include habitat type and seasonality in addition to latitude, UTL, LTL, ΔUTL, and ΔLTL. The seasonality is the measurement of the standard deviation of annual mean weekly air (or sea surface for marine habitats) temperatures extracted from Bioclim climatic layers. In this study, ΔUTL and ΔLTL are measured as acclimation response ratio, which is the slope of the line describing the change in thermal tolerance with a given change in acclimation temperature.
