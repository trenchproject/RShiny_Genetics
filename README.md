# RShiny_PlasticityTradeoff

PlasticityTradeoff is an interactive shiny app that allows any user to visualize the relationship between plasticity and thermal tolerance range across many taxa. The app uses the data colleted by [Calosi (2015)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0408) on beetles and a larger dataset published by [Gunderson & Stillman (2015)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2015.0401)
