<h4>Introduction</h4>
Despite evidence that organisms are shifting their distibutions in respone to climate change, we still have a lot to learn about the links between species' physiology and their vulnerability to climate change. Species that are unable to shift their range are particularly at risk from extinction if they cannot compensate physiologically. Therefore, understanding their acclimatory ability is key to understanding the climate change impacts on biodiversity.
<br>
There are two primary hypotheses that explain the variation in thermal plasticity among ectotherms.
<br>
The first one is the <b>Latitudinal hypothesis</b>. This hypothesis predicts that the thermal tolerance plasticity increases as organisms move towards the poles. The higher the latitude, the greater the seasonal variation, which forces organisms to be more thermally tolerant. Under this hypothesis, tropical organisms are at the most risk from climate warming due to its lack of acclimatory ability.
<br>
<br>
The other one is the <b>Trade-off hypothesis</b>. This hypothesis assumes that the organisms with the highest overall thermal tolerance will have the lowest tolerance plasticity. The underlying assumption here is that there is a trade-off between thermal tolerance and acclimatory ability. Therefore, organisms with broad thermal range are more vulnerable once the temperature exceeds the range compared to those with narrow thermal range. Under this hypothesis, tropical organisms will have the greatest acclimatory ability.

<h4>Beetles from Calosi (2007)</h4>
Keeping in mind the two hypotheses, let's look at a case study of European diving beetles conducted by <a href = "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0408?casa_token=dIOu64Eta7AAAAAA:qia_60BurHFPO0W_ho8Z-1BSzt1BiPPIc_TyEl18Ssdh0W8c-L5TxmTw--aix2xNeCf09NMoiayx5wE">Calosi et al. in 2007</a>.
<br>
For their experiment, they prepared 13 species of diving beetles, each separated in two groups. One group was raised at 14.5 °C and the other was raied at 20.5 °C to allow for acclimation to different seasonal temperatures within their range. They measured upper thermal limits (UTLs) and lower thermal limits (LTLs) for each group, and took the difference between the groups to quantify their acclimatory capacity. Additionally, they recored the range of latitude each species inhabit as latitudinal range extent (LRE) and latitudinal range central point (LRCP).
<br>
<br>
Before we discuss the two hypotheses, it is important to understand the premise. Both hypotheses expect that organisms closer to the equator tend to evolve a narrower thermal tolerance range. This is because the seasonal variation gets smaller as latitude decreases, and species' thermal tolerance is expected to align with it. 
<br>
Is that really the case? Hit the "Assumption" to see if there is a significant trend between thermal tolerance range and latitude.
<br>
The trendline is depicted solid if the trend is signifincant (p-value < 0.05), and dashed otherwise.
<br>
<br>
Now, let's see if the hypotheses are supported.
<br>
To test the latitudinal hypothesis, we can look at the relationship between the latitude and the beetles' acclimatory ability. Does the upper thermal limit change depending on their rearing temperature? How about the lower thermal limit? If we can see an increase in &Delta;UTL or a decrease in &Delta;UTL with latitude, the latitudinal hypothesis is supported.
<br>
Next, we can look at the relationship of the thermal tolerance range vs the acclimatory ability. If species with wider thermal tolerance range has a greater acclimatory ability, the trade-off hypothesis is supported. Additionally, Stillman found in a study on porcellanid crabs that those with the highest upper and lower thermal limits (UTL and LTL) have the lowest acclimatory capacities of these traits. We can examine if that trend exists for the beetles as well.
