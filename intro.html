<b>Thermal performance curves (TPC)</b> are a common way of depicting how body temperatures influence the ability of organisms to function and have been increasingly applied to predict vulnerability to climate change. TPCs are constructed with body temperature on the x-axis and the rate of a performance that influences survival or reproductive success on the y-axis. TPCs are hump shaped and tend to have a rapid decline in performance at warm temperatures. The lower and upper limits of the body temperature range over which performance is above zero are called the lower thermal limit (LTL) and upper thermal limit (UTL), respectively. The optimal temperature (Topt) is the body temperature at which the organism attains the highest performance. These three metrics (LTL, Topt, and UTL) are often reported as a simple way to describe a TPC.
The thermal tolerance range is simply the difference between UTL and LTL. Typically, organisms closer to the poles have a wider thermal tolerance range so that they can tolerate a wider range of seasonality.

<br>
The organisms are at risk when their body temperatures are near or outside their thermal tolerance range. Approaching or exceeding UTLs is becoming more prevalent due to climate change. Organisms are sometimes able to minimize thermal risk via acclimation to their environment. Phenotypic plasticity in response to a change in the environment can occur in response to both developmental conditions (developmental plasticity) and acute environmental changes (reversible plasticity). Mechanisms of the plasticity include expression of heat shock proteins and changes in membrane structure.  Organisms differ in their acclimatory ability (also called thermal plasticity) and their capacity for acclimation is a key determinant of vulnerability to climate change. 
<br>
There are two primary hypotheses that explain the variation in thermal plasticity among ectotherms.
<br>
The first one is the <b>Latitudinal hypothesis</b>. This hypothesis predicts that plasticity in thermal tolerance increases as organisms move towards the poles. The higher the latitude, the greater the seasonal variation, which forces organisms to be more thermally tolerant. Under this hypothesis, tropical organisms are at the most risk from climate warming due to its lack of acclimatory ability.
<br>
<br>
The other one is the <b>Trade-off hypothesis</b>. This hypothesis assumes that the organisms with the highest overall thermal tolerance will have the lowest tolerance plasticity. The underlying assumption here is that there is a trade-off between thermal tolerance and acclimatory ability. Therefore, organisms with a broad thermal range are more vulnerable once the temperature exceeds that range compared to those with a narrow thermal range. Under this hypothesis, tropical organisms will have the greatest acclimatory ability.

<h4>How to use this visualization</h4>
This visualization examines the acclimatory abilities of ectotherms. We first examine the results of an experiment focused on acclimation in water beetles [Link]. Studies of different organisms have differed in whether thermal tolerance tradeoff with acclimation capacity in thermal tolerance, so we then examine a compilation of data from many studies. Gunderson & Stillman (2015) collected data for acclimation studies across terrestrial, marine, and freshwater habitat for taxa including amphibians, crustaceans, fish, insects, and reptiles.

<h4>Beetles from Calosi (2007)</h4>
<!--Keeping in mind the two hypotheses, let's look at a case study of European diving beetles conducted by <a href = "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0408?casa_token=dIOu64Eta7AAAAAA:qia_60BurHFPO0W_ho8Z-1BSzt1BiPPIc_TyEl18Ssdh0W8c-L5TxmTw--aix2xNeCf09NMoiayx5wE">Calosi et al. in 2007</a>.
<br>
For their experiment, they prepared 13 species of diving beetles, each separated into two groups. One group was raised at 14.5 °C, and the other was raised at 20.5 °C to allow for acclimation to different seasonal temperatures within their range. They measured upper thermal limits (UTLs) and lower thermal limits (LTLs) for each group and took the difference between the groups to quantify their acclimatory capacity. Additionally, they recorded the northernmost and southernmost range of their distribution and obtained the latitudinal range central point (LRCP).
<br>
<br>
Before we discuss the two hypotheses, it is important to understand the premise. Both hypotheses expect that organisms closer to the equator tend to evolve a narrower thermal tolerance range. This is because the seasonal variation gets smaller as latitude decreases, and species' thermal tolerance is expected to align with it. 
<br>
Is that really the case? Hit the "Assumption" to see if there is a significant trend between thermal tolerance range and latitude.
<br>
The trendline is depicted solid if the trend is significant (p-value < 0.05), and dashed otherwise.
<br>
<br>
Now, let's see if the hypotheses are supported.
<br>
To test the latitudinal hypothesis, we can look at the relationship between the latitude and the beetles' acclimatory ability. Does the upper thermal limit change depending on their rearing temperature? How about the lower thermal limit? If we can see an increase in &Delta;UTL or a decrease in &Delta;UTL with latitude, the latitudinal hypothesis is supported.
<br>
Next, we can look at the relationship between the thermal tolerance range vs. the acclimatory ability. If species with a wider thermal tolerance range has a greater acclimatory ability, the trade-off hypothesis is supported. Additionally, Stillman found in a study on porcellanid crabs that those with the highest upper and lower thermal limits (UTL and LTL) have the lowest acclimatory capacities of these traits. We can examine if that trend exists for the beetles as well.-->
