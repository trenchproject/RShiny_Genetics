<h4>Introduction</h4>
Despite evidence that organisms are shifting their distributions in response to climate change, we still have a lot to learn about the links between species' physiology and their vulnerability to climate change.
<br>
Before we dive into the traits that are directly impacted by climate change, we will go over some concepts that are necessary to understand.

The graph on the right is an example of a <b>thermal performance curve (TPC)</b>. TPCs are constructed with body temperature on the x-axis and the rate of a performance that influences survival or reproductive success on the y-axis. The lower and upper limits of the body temperature range over which performance is above zero are called upper thermal limit (UTL), and lower thermal limit (LTL), respectively. The optimal temperature (Topt) is the body temperature at which the organism attains the highest performance. These three metrics (LTL, Topt, and UTL) are often reported as a simple way to describe a TPC. <br>
The thermal tolerance range is simply the difference between UTL and LTL. Typically, organisms closer to the poles have a wider thermal tolerance range so that they can tolerate a wider range of seasonality.
<br>
<br>
The organisms are at risk when their operative temperature is outside of their thermal tolerance range — mostly when it's above their UTL — and such situations are becoming more prevalent due to climate change. When facing untolerable temperatures, organisms have three ways to react. The first option is adaptation. Species can evolve novel traits that let them perform well in the changing climate. However, evolution typically occurs at a much slower rate than climate change, and it is oftentimes improbable to expect adaptation.

Second option is range shift. This is observed across a variety of taxa from fish to plants to birds. Specifically, organisms move higher up the elevation or latitude to seek for cooler environments. However, many species are geographically limited in their shifting range, or physically impossible to move fast enough due to thier restriction on mobility or size.
<br>
The third option is <b>acclimation</b>. Acclimation is a change in phenotype that occurs in response to a change in the environment. Some examples of acclimation are an increase in UTL in response to warmer rearing temperatures, and an increase in the number of red blood cells production when moved to high altitudes. Acclimation enables individuals to tolerate a greater temperature range when the climate changes. The extent to which organisms can acclimate, called acclimatory ability or thermal plasticity, depends on the species. Understanding their acclimatory ability is key to understanding climate change impacts on biodiversity as acclimation is the most probable response to the changing climate for many species. If a species is unable to make any of the three responses, it is going extinct.
<br>
For the purposes of this application, we are focusing on the acclimatory abilities of ectotherms. There are two primary hypotheses that explain the variation in thermal plasticity among ectotherms.
<br>
The first one is the <b>Latitudinal hypothesis</b>. This hypothesis predicts that the thermal tolerance plasticity increases as organisms move towards the poles. The higher the latitude, the greater the seasonal variation, which forces organisms to be more thermally tolerant. Under this hypothesis, tropical organisms are at the most risk from climate warming due to its lack of acclimatory ability.
<br>
<br>
The other one is the <b>Trade-off hypothesis</b>. This hypothesis assumes that the organisms with the highest overall thermal tolerance will have the lowest tolerance plasticity. The underlying assumption here is that there is a trade-off between thermal tolerance and acclimatory ability. Therefore, organisms with a broad thermal range are more vulnerable once the temperature exceeds that range compared to those with a narrow thermal range. Under this hypothesis, tropical organisms will have the greatest acclimatory ability.

<h4>Beetles from Calosi (2007)</h4>
<!--Keeping in mind the two hypotheses, let's look at a case study of European diving beetles conducted by <a href = "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0408?casa_token=dIOu64Eta7AAAAAA:qia_60BurHFPO0W_ho8Z-1BSzt1BiPPIc_TyEl18Ssdh0W8c-L5TxmTw--aix2xNeCf09NMoiayx5wE">Calosi et al. in 2007</a>.
<br>
For their experiment, they prepared 13 species of diving beetles, each separated into two groups. One group was raised at 14.5 °C, and the other was raised at 20.5 °C to allow for acclimation to different seasonal temperatures within their range. They measured upper thermal limits (UTLs) and lower thermal limits (LTLs) for each group and took the difference between the groups to quantify their acclimatory capacity. Additionally, they recorded the northernmost and southernmost range of their distribution and obtained the latitudinal range central point (LRCP).
<br>
<br>
Before we discuss the two hypotheses, it is important to understand the premise. Both hypotheses expect that organisms closer to the equator tend to evolve a narrower thermal tolerance range. This is because the seasonal variation gets smaller as latitude decreases, and species' thermal tolerance is expected to align with it. 
<br>
Is that really the case? Hit the "Assumption" to see if there is a significant trend between thermal tolerance range and latitude.
<br>
The trendline is depicted solid if the trend is significant (p-value < 0.05), and dashed otherwise.
<br>
<br>
Now, let's see if the hypotheses are supported.
<br>
To test the latitudinal hypothesis, we can look at the relationship between the latitude and the beetles' acclimatory ability. Does the upper thermal limit change depending on their rearing temperature? How about the lower thermal limit? If we can see an increase in &Delta;UTL or a decrease in &Delta;UTL with latitude, the latitudinal hypothesis is supported.
<br>
Next, we can look at the relationship between the thermal tolerance range vs. the acclimatory ability. If species with a wider thermal tolerance range has a greater acclimatory ability, the trade-off hypothesis is supported. Additionally, Stillman found in a study on porcellanid crabs that those with the highest upper and lower thermal limits (UTL and LTL) have the lowest acclimatory capacities of these traits. We can examine if that trend exists for the beetles as well.-->
